fastboot may or may not flash boot0,boot1 right 

tow-boot doesn't seem to work flashed to boot0,boot1 even from linux
but it doesn't burned to emmc where uefi seems to work

so, just build the tow-boot build, burn to SD with an offset, call it doesn

-> then you can boot aarch nixos installer and do normal gpt+efi install
